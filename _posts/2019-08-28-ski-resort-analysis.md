So I’m obsessed with snowboarding. Really obsessed. I’m planning on trying out at least two unique resorts per year, and to this end, I’ll be working on a Ski Resort dataset provided by Bellamy on Kaggle (see below).

First of all I’ll be cleaning up the data set since it was just scraped from Skiresort.info.

I’ll update this post as I go, and for now, here’s a histogram of ski resort altitudes within the data set:

I showed this to a close friend, and the outliers at 0 were immediately apparent. I’ll work on that to start! (No it’s not NaN values, I checked :))
