title: # TFIDF-Text-Summarization
---
## Project Definition
Text summarization API built using Sklearn TF-IDF, topic modeling and FastAPI.

## Project Breakdown:
### 1. Planning and setup

*Task definition and scope out requirements:*

- Raw text input
- Summarize input using TF-ID SKLearn NLP pipeline.
- Output summarized raw text
- Build web-API with ability to input and receive output
- Stretch:
    * Allow user to input model specs
    * Implement SQL backend for user creation and storage

*Project feasibility:*

- Input, model building and summarization output can be accomplished with ease.
- Web-API has the potential to be simple but over complicated as more features are added
- Backend might be reaching too far.

*Model tradeoffs:*

- We'll be sticking to TF-IDF for this project.

*Codebase:*
- Data
- Model
- Output
- API
