subtitle: Todd Gonzalez - Data Scientist
---

Data Science graduate at Lambda School with an A.S. in Computer Science at DeAnza College in Silicon Valley.

Machine Learning fanatic by day, avid snowboarder and explorer by night..? If I'm not deep in my next Neural Network project I'm either asleep, going 60mph down the slope or both. Music in my ears at all times to paint my surroundings in whichever color I choose. Highly competitive gamer, a bad loser but a damn good learner. Born and raised in Costa Rica, living in Boston and dreaming of Japan.
